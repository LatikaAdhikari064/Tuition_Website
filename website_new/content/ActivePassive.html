    <div class="section">
        <h2>What is Voice in Grammar?</h2>
        <p>
            In English grammar, <strong>voice</strong> refers to the form of a verb that indicates whether the subject of the sentence is performing the action (Active Voice) or receiving the action (Passive Voice).
        </p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Active Voice</h2>
        <p>
            In the <strong>Active Voice</strong>, the subject performs the action expressed by the verb. This form is direct, clear, and usually preferred in writing.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> The teacher (subject) explains (verb) the lesson (object).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Passive Voice</h2>
        <p>
            In the <strong>Passive Voice</strong>, the subject receives the action. The focus is on the object of the action rather than the doer.
        </p>
        <div class="example">
            <strong>Example:</strong> The lesson (subject) is explained (verb) by the teacher (agent).
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>Structure</h2>
        <h3>Active Voice Structure</h3>
        <p><em>Subject + Verb + Object</em></p>
        <h3>Passive Voice Structure</h3>
        <p><em>Object + Form of "to be" + Past Participle + (by + Subject)</em></p>
    </div>

    <div class="section">
        <h2>When to Use Passive Voice?</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>When the doer is unknown.</li>
            <li>When the doer is unimportant.</li>
            <li>When you want to emphasize the action or the receiver of the action.</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
