    <p>
      In English grammar, <strong>tenses</strong> are used to express the time of action. They help indicate whether an action takes place in the past, present, or future.
      Tenses are broadly classified into three main types, each further divided into four sub-types.
    </p>

    <h2>1. Present Tense</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple Present:</strong> Used for general truths or habitual actions.
        <div class="example">Example: She goes to school every day.</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Present Continuous:</strong> Actions happening right now.
        <div class="example">Example: They are playing football.</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Present Perfect:</strong> Actions completed recently or with relevance to the present.
        <div class="example">Example: I have finished my homework.</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Present Perfect Continuous:</strong> Actions that began in the past and are still continuing.
        <div class="example">Example: She has been working here for 5 years.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. Past Tense</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple Past:</strong> Completed actions in the past.
        <div class="example">Example: He visited Delhi last year.</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Past Continuous:</strong> Ongoing actions in the past.
        <div class="example">Example: I was reading when she called.</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Past Perfect:</strong> Actions completed before another past action.
        <div class="example">Example: They had left before we arrived.</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Past Perfect Continuous:</strong> Actions that were ongoing for some time in the past before another event.
        <div class="example">Example: He had been working there for 3 years before he moved.</div>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. Future Tense</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Simple Future:</strong> Actions that will happen in the future.
        <div class="example">Example: I will visit London next month.</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Future Continuous:</strong> Ongoing actions in the future.
        <div class="example">Example: She will be studying at 8 PM tonight.</div>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Future Perfect:</strong> Actions that will be completed before a certain time in the future.
